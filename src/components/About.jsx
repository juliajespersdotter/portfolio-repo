				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio!</p>
				<p>
					My name is Julia, and I am a passionate and dedicated
					fullstack developer with 2 years of experience. I have a
					strong background in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various
					frameworks, and I am always eager to expand my knowledge and
					skills.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have a deep appreciation for the power of technology and
					its ability to bring ideas to life. I take great pride in
					creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites that
					meet the needs of both clients and users. I believe in
					paying attention to every detail and striving for excellence
					in everything I do.
				</p>
				<p>
					Throughout my studies, I have had the opportunity to use
					various technologies in both backend and frontend during my
					school internships such as creating API's in ASP.NET with
					C#, building websites in React with TypeScript, site
					building in the CMS Drupal and managing data on the backend.
					If you are looking for a web developer who is dedicated,
					experienced, and driven by a passion for excellence, then
					look no further. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I
					look forward to connecting with you soon.
